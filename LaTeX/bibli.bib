	abstract = {Carpooling is an effective solution to major environmental problems but it is insufficiently used, particularly in France. In order to increase carpooling, it is important to understand why people do or not carpool. This study, carried out a large sample of drivers, was aimed at (1) identifying whether or not people carpool, (2) investigating the factual data (e.g. socio-demographics, transportation accessibility) and motivational factors (e.g. attitudes regarding car use, public transportation, environment) upon which carpoolers and non-carpoolers differ, and (3) highlighting the main determinants of the practice of carpooling. An online survey was administered to 1207 French drivers (48\% men, ages 19–87) recruited by means of a random-quota method. In our sample, 52.5\% of the participants said they were using carpooling. Carpoolers and non-carpoolers were similar in terms of kilometers driven per year, distance to their workplace or schools/universities, and public transportation accessibility. Compared to non-carpoolers, carpoolers were more likely to be women, have children, have positive attitudes toward public transport, and be more environmentally aware. These results suggest various different strategies for increasing the number of carpoolers and the frequency of carpooling use by taking into account the gender of road users.},

The daily patterns of NO2, NOx, and particulates concentrations at roadside and background stations are similar while no common daily concentration pattern of SO2 can be found. Concentration at nearby roadside and background stations are closely correlated for all pollutants investigated. Daily variations of NO2, NOx, and particulates concentrations at roadside and urban background stations follow the traffic pattern of the area closely.

Zusammenfassung
Die Auswirkungen der Energiekrise auf das Verkehrsgeschehen in ausgewählten amerikanischen Städten werden untersucht. Auf der Basis von Fahrtenzahlen im Berufspendlerverkehr, die aus der Volkszählung 1970 stammen, lieβen sich Veränderungen bei den Fahrgemeinschaften und in der Benutzung alternativer Verkehrsmittel abschätzen. Für Analysen in bestimmten Städten werden Vorschläge entwickelt; insbesondere wird die Verkehrsplanung für das Gebiet von Baltimore, Maryland, kritisch beleuchtet. Allgemein läβt sich feststellen, daβ begrenzte Energieverknappungen (etwa von 10 Prozent) nicht zu ernsthaften Beeinträchtigungen des Pendlerverkehrs führen dürften.},

	abstract = {Carpooling, i.e. the sharing of vehicles to reach common destinations, is often performed to reduce costs and pollution. Recent work on carpooling takes into account, besides mobility matches, also social aspects and, more generally, non-monetary incentives. In line with this, we present GRAAL, a data-driven methodology for GReen And sociAL carpooling. GRAAL optimizes a carpooling system not only by minimizing the number of cars needed at the city level, but also by maximizing the enjoyability of people sharing a trip. We introduce a measure of enjoyability based on people’s interests, social links, and tendency to connect to people with similar or dissimilar interests. GRAAL computes the enjoyability within a set of users from crowd-sourced data, and then uses it on real world datasets to optimize a weighted linear combination of number of cars and enjoyability. To tune this weight, and to investigate the users’ interest on the social aspects of carpooling, we conducted an online survey on potential carpooling users. We present the results of applying GRAAL on real world crowd-sourced data from the cities of Rome and San Francisco. Computational results are presented from both the city and the user perspective. Using the crowd-sourced weight, GRAAL is able to significantly reduce the number of cars needed, while keeping a high level of enjoyability on the tested data-set. From the user perspective, we show how the entire per-car distribution of enjoyability is increased with respect to the baselines.},

We investigate the jockeying behavior of work commuters between carpooling and driving alone modes through solving each model for both no-toll equilibrium and social optimum. The logit-based stochastic model involves the consideration on preference option of mode choice. Under some assumptions, the paper explains how the amount of carpooling is affected by fuel cost, assembly cost, value of time, preferential or attitudinal factors and traffic congestion. It is found that carpooling is sensitive to traffic congestion reduction only when a congestion externality-based tolling scheme is implemented.},

	abstract = {Car pooling is one method that can be easily instituted and can help to resolve a variety of problems that continue to plague urban areas, ranging from energy demands and traffic congestion to environmental pollution. Although car pooling is becoming more common, in practice, participant matching results are still being obtained by an inefficient manual approach, which may possibly result in an inferior solution. In the past, when car pooling studies have been done the problem has been treated as either a to-work problem (from different origins to the same destination) or return-from-work problem (from the same origin to different destinations). However, in this study we employ a time-space network flow technique to develop a model for the many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle types and person types. The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. Since real problem sizes can be huge, it could be difficult to find optimal solutions within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we develop a solution algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation, a subgradient method, and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm can be applied to real world, we randomly generated several examples based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan, on which we performed numerical tests. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.},

The mobility managers of the Università Statale and Politecnico di Milano universities are interested in promoting the use of such system among their students and employees. The paper presents an ongoing project to design, implement and test PoliUniPool, a car pooling service for such universities. The main characteristics of the PoliUniPool service are the following: (1) the use of the system is restricted to employees, faculty and students of the two universities; (2) besides suggesting a matching between the users, the system provides the expected schedule for their trips; (3) in addition to the campus premises, users can select – as destination of their car pooling trips – the main railway and subway stations, in order to encourage the most environmental friendly means; (4) users are informed immediately in case of delay or changes, to improve the reliability of the service; (5) the system estimates the costs for each user, in order to let the users know how to share them; (6) the system has some social network functionalities, e.g. drivers are able to set partial pre-arranged crews; and users may indicate other users they would prefer to car-pool with (“friends”) or they don’t want to (“I don’t like him/her”). A web-based software tool has been implemented to manage the matching of the users. In order to solve the carpooling problem, we use an heuristics, based on a guided Monte Carlo method. The algorithm minimizes an objective function, subject to user time windows and car capacity constraints. The objective function is a weighted sum of different terms in order to maximize the number of served users, minimizing the total route length, and maximizing the satisfied user preferences (e.g. friends). The result is a matching between drivers and passengers, their schedules and the routes to be driven by each driver. The trial of the proposed service will start on September 2011 and will take into account how to introduce and promote the service, identifying regulation, incentives, modalities, and marketing actions.},

All requests must be performed without violating either the vehicle capacity or the customer time window stipulated at each location. In this paper, we present a reactive tabu search approach to solve the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using three distinct move neighborhoods that capitalize on the dominance of the precedence and coupling constraints. A hierarchical search methodology is used to dynamically alternate between neighborhoods in order to negotiate different regions of the solution space and adjust search trajectories. In order to validate our technique's effectiveness, we have constructed a new set of benchmark problems for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows based on Solomon's benchmark vehicle routing problem with time windows data sets. Computational results substantiate the solution quality and efficiency of our reactive tabu search approach.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows and multiple vehicles (PDPTW). The first stage uses a simple simulated annealing algorithm to decrease the number of routes, while the second stage uses Large neighborhood search (LNS) to decrease total travel cost. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm which has produced many new best solutions on problems with 100, 200, and 600 customers. In particular, it has improved 47\% and 76\% of the best solutions on the 200 and 600-customer benchmarks, sometimes by as much as 3 vehicles. These results further confirm the benefits of two-stage approaches in vehicle routing. They also answer positively the open issue in the original LNS paper, which advocated the use of LNS for the PDPTW and argue for the robustness of LNS with respect to side-constraints.},

	abstract = {Growing traffic congestion and the associated externalities require the study of alternative measures to reduce the number of automobiles travelling every day to the city centres, specifically single-occupant vehicles. Carpooling is a system by which a person shares his or her private vehicle with one or more people that have similar destinations. A conceptual model for carpooling simulation is presented to study the viability of carpooling clubs in a given region. Based on statistical data from single-occupant commuter trips and using roulette wheel selection, one aims to simulate the behaviour of potential carpooling users. This paper emphasizes the construction process of a Logic Flow Diagram that translates the proposed methodology, allowing organizing the different activities, input parameters and discrete events in a structure that can be used to study any given urban area.},

	abstract = {The distribution of finished products from depots to customers is a practical and challenging problem in logistics management. Better routing and scheduling decisions can result in higher level of customer satisfaction because more customers can be served in a shorter time. The distribution problem is generally formulated as the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Nevertheless, there is a rigid assumption that there is only one depot. In cases, for instance, where a logistics company has more than one depot, the VRP is not suitable. To resolve this limitation, this paper focuses on the VRP with multiple depots, or multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). The MDVRP is NP-hard, which means that an efficient algorithm for solving the problem to optimality is unavailable. To deal with the problem efficiently, two hybrid genetic algorithms (HGAs) are developed in this paper. The major difference between the HGAs is that the initial solutions are generated randomly in HGA1. The Clarke and Wright saving method and the nearest neighbor heuristic are incorporated into HGA2 for the initialization procedure. A computational study is carried out to compare the algorithms with different problem sizes. It is proved that the performance of HGA2 is superior to that of HGA1 in terms of the total delivery time.},

The route-directed hybrid genetic approach is based upon the simultaneous evolution of two populations of solutions focusing on separate objectives subject to temporal constraint relaxation. While the first population evolves individuals to minimize total traveled distance the second aims at minimizing temporal constraint violation to generate a feasible solution. Genetic operators have been designed to capture key concepts from successful routing techniques to further enhance search diversification and intensification. A master–slave message-passing paradigm characterizes the parallel procedure. The master component controls the execution of the algorithm, coordinates genetic operations and handles parent selection while the slave elements concurrently execute reproduction and mutation operators. Providing additional speed-up, the parallel algorithm further expands on its sequential counterpart, matching or even improving solution quality. Computational results show the proposed technique to be very competitive with the best-known heuristic routing procedures providing some new best-known solutions.},

The model minimizes the total cost of hub location and vehicle routing, subject to predefined travel time, hub capacity, vehicle capacity, and simultaneous pickups and deliveries. A polynomial-size mixed integer programming formulation is introduced for the single allocation type of the problems. In this paper, a set of valid inequalities is proposed for the formulation. In addition, a tabu-search based heuristic is suggested which determines the hub location and vehicle routes simultaneously. Series of computational tests are then executed to evaluate the performance of valid inequalities and tabu-search based heuristic. The results show that using all valid inequalities improves the solution time of the pure proposed model. Meanwhile, the proposed heuristic works efficiently in finding good-quality solutions for the proposed hub location-routing model.},

The main elements in designing a distribution network are location and routing decisions. As these elements are interdependent in many distribution networks, the overall system cost can decrease if location and routing decisions are simultaneously tackled. In this paper, we consider a Capacitated Location-Routing Problem with Mixed Backhauls (CLRPMB) which is a general case of the capacitated location-routing problem. CLRPMB is defined as finding locations of the depots and designing vehicle routes in such a way that pickup and delivery demands of each customer must be performed with the same vehicle and the overall cost is minimized. Since CLRPMB is an NP-hard problem, we propose a memetic algorithm to solve the problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct an experimental study and compare its results with the lower bounds obtained by the branch-and-cut algorithm on a set of instances derived from the literature. Computational results indicate that the proposed approach is able to find optimal or very good quality solutions in a reasonable computation time.},

The car pooling problem consists of defining the subsets of employees that will share each car and the paths the drivers should follow, so that sharing is maximized and the sum of the path costs is minimized. The special case of the car pooling problem where all cars are identical can be modeled as a Dial-a-Ride Problem. In this paper, we propose both an exact and a heuristic method for the car pooling problem, based on two integer programming formulations of the problem. The exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the problem. A valid upper bound is obtained by the heuristic method, which transforms the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution.
