	% ABSTRACT
	\begin{abstract}
		\noindent The problem of carpooling is a problem of satisfaction for users who would like to have as little inconvenience as possible. We can cite some of the inconveniences of current carpooling systems, such as inadequate schedules, long detours, or not enough flexibility, home-to-work trips.
		\newpar
		We have studied the possibilities of minimizing these inconveniences, and here are the main points:\newline 
		Our system offers a daily solution to avoid long-term commitment problems and to have more flexibility.\newline 
		Our system allows users to have different places of work, either if the user does not have a fixed place of work, or if he wants to go somewhere before going home. The user can also have several places of residence within a single day, if he does not want to return to the same place. Thus, the user can have one origin and destination in the morning, then another origin and destination in the evening.
		\newpar
		Our objective is to create user groups to minimize the distance travelled by users while maximizing vehicle occupancy. \newline
		Furthermore, we will study the impact of these inconveniences on the possible solutions, by varying the possible advance at work, as well as by varying the authorized detour lengths.

	\chapter{Introduction}
	
	Carpooling is subject to intense research, yet many users continue to take their personal car. Private car use accounts for the largest part of kilometers traveled and is considered one of the most important contributors to air pollution \cite{laucontributions2008}. Promoting eco-friendly transportation modes (such as public transportation, bicycle, walking, or carpooling) is becoming more and more frequent. However, even with increasing environmental awareness and concern, many road users are still car-dependent, either by choice or constrained by circumstances \cite{stradeterminants2007}. These car-dependent users therefore have no access to any other means of transportation. The carpooling is the most suitable alternative \cite{delhommecomparing2016}.
	\newpar 
	To position ourselves we will talk about different types of carpooling.
	
	% OBJECT
	\section{Object: The kinds of carpooling }\label{sec:The kinds of carpooling}
	We will start by defining what carpooling is. Definitions vary considerably in the literature, nevertheless we can form a general definition of the idea behind these terms. Carpooling is the use of private cars, unlike car-sharing which uses cars assigned to a system. We can define it by forming groups of people, say pools, each sharing the same car. These pools are on average formed by more than one person per car. The people of the pool participate, by various means, in the expenses generated by the trips.\newline
	There are many systems for connecting people, such as websites that ask users who go from one city to another to enter their route, or universities and companies themselves forming groups of people based on their own data.
	\newpar
	Carpooling is studied since the seventies \cite{wohlmethodology1970} \cite{sagnerimpact1974}, and two types of carpooling problems have been defined since the 2000s \cite{kotharigenghis-multiagent2004} \cite{maniezzoants2004} \cite{calvodistributed2004}. There are significant differences depending on the literature chosen regarding the definition of these two groups.\newline
		\tab The Daily CarPooling Problem \textbf{DCPP} concerns the formation of pools, possibly different each day. We can say that the pools of each day are independent of the elders.\newline
		\tab The Long Term CarPooling Problem \textbf{LCPP} concerns the formation of regular and stable pools over a given period. Some articles talk about the variation of who takes his car in each pool formed \cite{guometaheuristics2012}. 
	
	\subsection*{Difference between DCPP and LCPP}
	Each figure below represents (a) the requests and (b) a proposed solution. Each circle represents a request from a user wishing to go to work. The work is represented by a dark grey square. \newline
	In the solution, users who take their car, thus becoming drivers, are represented by a light grey circle. The arches represent the path taken by the driver.\newline 
	The following figures show examples to highlight the difference between the DCPP and the LCPP over \textbf{two consecutive days}.

	Figure \ref{fig:DCPP D2} represents the following day of the Figure \ref{fig:DCPP D1}. We can see that there are no longer the same users. Some have not renewed their requests, and some new requests must be taken into account. Thus, we can see that the user $A$ becomes a passenger on the second day, whereas he left to work alone on the first day. The user $B$ was a passenger on the first day, and goes to work alone on the second day.
	\newpar
	Now let's see the LCPP examples.

	In Figure \ref{fig:LCPP D2}, the regularity is put forward: we have the same users as in Figure \ref{fig:LCPP D1}. The pools have remained, the solution is to vary the drivers. Changes may obviously occur, however the goal remains to maintain a certain consistency.
	\newpar
	Now that we know what carpooling is, we will see what are the issues of carpooling. 
	
	% ISSUES
	\section*{Issues of the carpooling}
	
	Carpooling has advantages for the city and for users, we can cite the reduction of traffic jams, pollution and accidents. It also leads to freer parking, savings and more user-friendliness \cite{berlingeriograal2017}.
	\newpar
	By analyzing a few articles, we have compiled lists, representing the advantages and disadvantages for carpool users, as well as the advantages for companies that their employees make the trip together \cite{huangmodels2000} \cite{onwubolunew2004} \cite{yanoptimization2011} \cite{bruglieripoliunipool:2011}.
	\begin{tabbing}
		{\bfseries Advantages for the user:}\\
		\tab \= Split\=ting of expenses \\
		\> Compared to public transports \> \\
		\> \> No waiting \\
		\> \> Less time \\
		\> \> No walk \\
		\> Less need to get a special car to work \> \\
		\> Reduce traffic congestion / traffic volumes \> \\
		\> Reduce noise levels \> \\
		\> Reduce air pollution (vehicles emission) \> \\
		\> Fewer accidents \> \\
		\> Fuel savings \> \\
		{\bfseries Disadvantages for the user:} \\
		\> Flexible hours: not convenient \\

		\> Increase travel time \\
		\> \> Pick up \\
		\> \> Deliver \\
		\> \> Mutual waiting \\
		\> Loss of independence \\
		\> Loss of privacy \\
		\> Loss of self-reliance \\
		\> Anonymity of the vehicle creates a more comfortable social climate \\
		\> \> Public cars \\
		{\bfseries Advantages for the companies: }\\
		\> Maximize the use of employee parking \\
		\> Sociability between the employees \\
		\> Reduce stress in driving to work \\
		\> Improve the company image \\
	\end{tabbing}
	
	\noindent From this list, we can mention the disadvantages on which we will work, namely flexible working hours, travel time and user independence. \newline
	Still according to the articles,\cite{huangmodels2000} \cite{onwubolunew2004} \cite{yanoptimization2011} \cite{bruglieripoliunipool:2011} we can separate the \textbf{issues} into different categories:
	\newpar
	\textbf{Environmental} issues related to reducing the consumption of non-renewable energy (oil) and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
	\newpar
	\textbf{Structural} issues related to the reduction in the number of vehicles on the roads and developments related to parking. Carpooling facilities are becoming more common, such as free outdoor parking for carpoolers, near transportation or meeting points for carpoolers. If some structures are no longer useful, such as a three-lane road, the city would build new structures for the sustainable development of the city, such as green spaces and cycle paths.
	\newpar
	\textbf{Economic} issues with the reduction of the cost of road maintenance for the city, and the cost of vehicle wear and tear for the user.
	\newpar
	With the collection of data on carpooling, we would observe traffic flows in order to implement new solutions, such as the development of a new subsidiary road in a place with many companies. There are other viable solutions, such as traffic light management or the creation of new roundabouts. 
	\newpar
	We have the background to define the context in which the subject of our report is set.

	% CONTEXT
	\section*{Context of the report}
	In this report, we are interested in carpooling in France, more particularly in the case of the Grenoble conurbation and its surroundings. The French use carpooling less than their European neighbours, the reasons they give are that they have better \textbf{control of their schedule}, they arrive \textbf{on time at work}, and it is \textbf{faster} \cite{delhommecomparing2016}. In response we have set up some ways to take into account these reasons.
	\newpar
	With regard to the \textbf{control of the schedule}, we decided to make a system based on \textbf{daily carpooling}, to be able to change the schedule of the next day. \newline
	We also manage the \textbf{return trip from work}, to be closer to the user's schedule. \newline
	We also allow the user to have \textbf{different origins and destinations in the morning and evening}. \newline
	Thanks to these specificities, users benefit from greater flexibility and a more respected schedule.
	\newpar
	Regarding the arrival \textbf{on time at work}, we set up a \textbf{time window} to \textbf{not be too ahead at work}: it is a time window between zero and a fixed time. We will explain it more in detail later. \newline
	The return trip has a similar time window system, in order to \textbf{avoid the user to wait too long} after finishing his job. 
	\newpar
	Finally, we set up a management of the travel time, to define either a \textbf{percentage of the trip allowed time}, or a \textbf{fixed time}, or \textbf{both}. \newline
	For example, on a user's 100-kilometre home-work trip, if we allow a 10 per cent detour and add 10 kilometres of detour, the result will be 100 kilometres plus 10 kilometres plus 10 kilometres, which is 120 kilometres of travel allowed for that user. 
	\newpar
	To reduce traffic congestion in Grenoble, the study focuses on the home-work commute. 
	\newpar
	We will give more details, with illustrations of examples in the presentation of the problem \ref{fig:same workplace}. To understand the current situation, we will talk about smartphone applications that are currently on the French market. 
	
	% Existing applications
	\section*{Existing applications}
	
	It is important to talk about existing applications for home-to-work trip because we need to understand the specificities of existing systems.\newline
	The carpooling market from one city to another is owned by BlaBlaCar \cite{dionneblablacar2018}.However, when it comes to carpooling from home to work, their subsidiary BlaBlaLines has competition. We will quickly see what characterizes each of the flagship \textbf{applications} of the moment.
	\newpar
	\textbf{BlaBlaLines} links users according to their schedule, allowing a detour of at most fifteen minutes for a trip. Ultimately, they would like to set up a system of "lines" on busy roads, where drivers receive matching requests to their schedule and their road, and have the choice to accept or ignore it \cite{noauthorblablalines2017}. Their goal is to have as much flexibility as possible with no long-term commitment .
	\newpar
	\textbf{Klaxit} mainly relies on partnerships with communities and companies. Its principle is to find regular close carpoolers \cite{ARNULFKlaxit2018}. It fits with people who often have the same hours within the same company.
	\newpar
	\textbf{Karos} combines car and public transport. In addition, the application will learn from your usual routes to offer you matching carpoolers \cite{noauthorkaros2016}.
it fits with people who periodically do the same circuit.
	\newpar
	Each of these applications have theirs advantages and theirs disadvantages, with customer types specific to each. However, the market seems to be able to offer more in view of the very low occupancy rate per car during home-to-work journeys \cite{noauthoroccupancy2008}. \newline
	In addition, the French government is implementing the reimbursement of home-to-work journeys during strike periods, which is beneficial for both users and applications \cite{noauthorgreve2018}.
	\newpar
	Having the necessary background for understanding the report, we will see the order of chapters in the next section.
	% Conduct of the project
	\section*{Conduct of the project}
	Here is an introduction to the chapters and the guideline followed throughout the report.
	\newpar
	First, the positioning in the literature of our subject will be highlighted. The existing will be presented, as well as the contribution to the research of our problematic.\newline
	Secondly, the problem will be explained in detail, with illustrations of the original concepts that we bring in relation to the existing.\newline
	Third, the data model and the mathematical model used in this internship will be presented. We will explain the constraints and data used, in order to understand the resolution method used.\newline
	Finally, we will see how the data was generated and/or recovered. We will initiate the scenarios, the expected results, then we will present and analyze the results obtained.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATE OF THE ART %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\cleardoublepage
	\chapter{State of the art}
	
	Carpooling is a vast and varied field, and the existing articles concern as much specific points as general cases.
	\newpar
	First, we will define the class of the problem.
	
	% Class of the problem

	All these problems can be treated with the management or not of time windows. In the case of \textbf{DARP}, and therefore \textbf{DCPP} and \textbf{LCPP}, this management is included. \newline
	We manage people daily with our system, so \textbf{we are in the case of a Daily CarPooling Problem DCPP}.
	\newpar
	Now that we have defined problem classes, let's speak about resolution methods: There are either heuristics methods, or exact methods, or a combination of both(hybrid).
	
	% Resolution methods
	\section{Resolution methods}
	
	In this section will be presented some existing articles about the subject.
	
	\subsection{Exact methods}
	
	Exact methods are objectives and constraints giving an exact solution on a linear program. \newline 
	Mr. Cordeau \cite{cordeaubranch-and-cut2006} \cite{yanoptimization2011} is solving a DARP with a Branch-and-Cut linear program. $MDCPP$ is an extension designating the consideration of multi-destination, there are several places of work instead of one, and Mr. Guo \cite{guometaheuristics2012} presents it in his chapter 5. In a survey\cite{parraghsurvey2008} the differences in constraints between a PDP and a DARP will be shown.
	
	\subsection{Heuristics}
	The management of many data is not possible for problems that are not solvable in a polynomial time. This is why heuristic algorithms have been designed to obtain viable solutions on large instances. 
	\newpar
	\textsc{Genetic}\newline
	The principle of Genetic Algorithms \textbf{GA} is based on three phases:\newline
	\textbf{Natural selection}: Selection of individuals most likely to obtain the best results. \newline
	\textbf{Crossing}: Crossing of individuals with a probability between $0$ and $1$. \newline
	\textbf{Mutation}: Probability of mutation of an individual between $0.001$ and $0.01$. \newline
	Mr. Huang uses this algorithm in cloud computing which consists in harnessing the computing or storage power of remote computer servers via a network \cite{huanggenetic-algorithm-based2015}. \newline
	There are variants to these algorithms, such as GGA and AGA: \newline
	Guided Genetic Algorithm \textbf{GGA} is a Genetic Algorithm Oriented for Selection and Crossing \cite{guometaheuristics2012}. In Multi-Agent Self-Adaptive Genetic Algorithm \textbf{AGA}, each agent shares its progress with other agents. Learning mechanisms guide the genetic structure in order to have more appropriate choices. \cite{guometaheuristics2012} 
	\newpar
	\textsc{Tabu}\newline
	The principle of Tabu Algorithms \textbf{TA} is to find local minimums, save their position in a queue so as not to return to an already explored position. It is used in particular by Mr. Gendreau \cite{gendreautabu1996}, by Mrs. Li and Lim \cite{limetaheuristic2003}, and by Mr. Cordeau \cite{cordeautabu2003}. 
	\newpar
	\textsc{Simulation Based Approach}\newline
	Use the K-averaging algorithm to form groups \cite{correiaconceptual2009}.
	\newpar
	\textsc{Neighborhood Search Variable}\newline
	Search among "far-off" for the best local solution \cite{polacekvariable2004}.
	\newpar
	\textsc{Clustering Ants Colony}\newline
	Forms clusters during the construction of the "paths" of agents (ants) \cite{mazzeoant2004} \cite{guometaheuristics2012}.
	
	\subsection{Hybrid methods}
	Hybrid methods make it possible to associate a heuristic method with an exact method, two heuristics or two exact methods, in order to have a good compromise between different objectives.
	\newpar
	In the article \textsc{Hybrid Heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows}\cite{russellhybrid1995} both tour construction and local search tour improvement heuristics are developped. In the article \textsc{A parallel hybrid genetic algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows}\cite{bergerparallel2004} a parallel version of a new hybrid genetic algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows is presented. The route-directed hybrid genetic approach is based upon the simultaneous evolution of two populations of solutions focusing on separate objectives subject to temporal constraint relaxation. While the 1rst population evolves individuals to minimize total traveled distance the second aims at minimizing temporal constraint violation to generate a feasible solution. In the article \textsc{A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows}\cite{benttwo-stage2006}, the first stage uses a simple simulated annealing algorithm to decrease the number of routes, while the second stage uses Large neighborhood search (LNS) to decrease total travel cost. In the article \textsc{A hybrid genetic algorithm for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem}\cite{hohybrid2008}, to deal with the problem efficiently, two hybrid genetic algorithms (HGAs) are developed in this paper. The major difference between the HGAs is that the initial solutions are generated randomly in HGA1. The Clarke and Wright saving method and the nearest neighbor heuristic are incorporated into HGA2 for the initialization procedure. In \textsc{A hybrid genetic algorithm for multidepot and periodic vehicle routing problems}\cite{vidalhybrid2012} Another metaheuristic combines the exploration breadth of population-based evolutionary search, the aggressive-improvement capabilities of neighborhood-based metaheuristics, and advanced population-diversity management schemes.
	\newpar
	Mr. Baldacci propose both an exact and a heuristic method for the carpooling problem, based on two integer programming formulations of the problem. The exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the problem. A valid upper bound is obtained by the heuristic method, which transforms the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution \cite{baldacciexact2004}.

	% SUMMARY
	\section{Summary of the state of the art}
	
	To summarize and relate to our problem, we will design a decision support system that will determine the pools used each day. We are in the case of a daily carpooling problem \textbf{DCPP}. \\
	We will also develop an \textbf{exact resolution method}. Then we will have \textbf{heuristics} to manage more users. We will therefore form \textbf{hybrid} techniques to have solutions on larger instances.

	This table \ref{fig:Existing references on the different problems} shows whether articles offer solutions for general problems or more specific problems. Existing research provides generic models to cover as many problems as possible. Other articles are based on this research to go further on a specificity. Carpooling problems have completely different solutions depending on the user satisfaction criteria taken into account.
	\newpar
	There are already articles and systems dealing with DCPP, but people in France do not use carpooling much compared to other European countries, and one of the main reasons is is that they want to keep flexibility. \newline
	The originality brought in this report is the \textbf{management of return trip} in the specific case of \textbf{home-to-work trips}. \newline
	In addition, we also take into account a possible \textbf{return trip different} from the home-to-work trip. \newline
	Then we will study the peculiarities of the city of \textbf{Grenoble} to establish heuristics, like using motorway exists as deposit points(\textbf{Satellites}). 
	\newpar
	We will now present the problem in more detail.

	Users wishing to carpool must, for each request, enter their vehicle capacity, address, work address and work schedule. These are the classic features of carpooling problems.
	\newpar
	Our DCPP is located in the VRP branch, and one of the most common objectives of the VRP is to minimize the total travel cost.

	% Original characteristics
	\section{Original characteristics}
	\subsection*{Return management}
	
	Return management remains an original criterion in the DCPP because Mr. GUO uses it in the context of the LCPP \cite{guometaheuristics2012}, and the objective of the LCPP is to have stable pools, with the same people for the home-work trip and for the corresponding return trip. Although we do not have this constraint in the DCPP, we can have different pools.

	\subsection*{An user with multiple homes and workplaces}
	One of the other originalities of the basic problem is to have places of return from work different from those where we go to work. This is useful for example for someone who has a job where he has to change places during the day, or if someone wants to go to an activity after work. The purpose of this feature is to give more freedom to people who want to carpool.

	\subsection*{Another kind of time windows}
	
	Another originality is the way we manage time windows. Indeed, it corresponds to an authorized advance time before the beginning of the work. The same thing on the way home, with an authorized waiting time at work after the end of work. \newline
	We have time windows where the user must leave home in this interval: \newline
	{[work start time + maximum travel time, work start time + direct travel time]} \newline
	and time of arrival at work in that interval: \newline
	{work start time - time allocated in advance, work start time]}.

	In figure \ref{fig:Arrival to work waiting time} we can see that it takes 15 minutes to travel between the two workplaces. If it is allowed to have an advance waiting time of 20 minutes (a), then a user can drop the other one 15 minutes in advance, and has time to get to work on time. If, on the other hand, there is only 10 minutes of waiting time allowed, the solution is that everyone takes his car, so that there is no user too early.

	Figure \ref{fig:Departure from work waiting time} shows this time the return from work. This follows the same pattern as Figure \ref{fig:Arrival to work waiting time}, by allowing more or less waiting time after work, the solution can also evolve.

	\subsection*{Use of satellites places}
	
	Satellite locations are places where people can be dropped off and picked up, close to a place such as home or workplace. This can be useful to the problem, in order to have more similar data and perhaps to leave more possibilities of results. For example a motorway exit close to many workplaces within 1km walk can be a good satellite point.

	In Figure \ref{fig:Satellite range} we can observe a satellite point that can be used as the same point instead of using both workplaces.

	We will now see in which complexity class we can put this problem.

	\section{Complexity of the problem}
	
	To prove the complexity of the problem, we will take another problem whose complexity is known, and then prove that our problem is at least as difficult.
	
	\subsection{Hamiltonian Path Problem}

	A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex of the graph exactly once.\newline
	Let's consider a generic Hamiltonian Path Problem \textbf{HPP}: \newline
	\tab Let a graph $G=(V,E)$, with weighted edges $w:E\mapsto \mathbb{R}$, and a bound B.\newline
	Is there a Hamiltonian path in $G$ whose sum of weights is less or equal than $B$ ?\newline
	This problem is known to be of \textbf{NP-hard} complexity.

	Now that we have defined the NP-hard problem, let's define our carpooling problem.
	
	\subsection{CarPooling Problem}
	
	Let's consider the following generic CarPooling Problem \textbf{CPP}: \newline
	\tab Users of a carpooling system issue requests of the form $(O_i, D_i)$ corresponding to the origin and destination of the user $i$. Each user can be either passenger or driver. \newline
	The origins and destinations correspond to the vertices of a graph.\newline
	\tab Consider a graph $G'=(V',E')$, where $V'$ is the union between the vertices origins and the vertices destination $V'=(O\cup D)$, and $E'$ corresponds to the edges between these vertices. \newline
	\tab Each of the origin vertices has a weight corresponding to a vehicle capacity $c:O\mapsto \mathbb{N}$. \newline
	\tab Each edge has a weight corresponding to a distance between the two vertices it relies $w':E\mapsto \mathbb{R}$.\newline
	The goal is to minimize the sum of distances so that each user goes from his origin to his destination.

	If we only have one car and remove the Origin-Destination W trip, then our CPP solution are HPP solutions as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Example of a solution to CPP in the HPP}.
	\newpar
	Our instances of the CPP can only have \textbf{one vehicle} as a solution:\newline
	Let's see the case where there are two vehicles going to the destinations.\newline
	If we take two vehicles then we have in our solution at least twice the distance $W$.\newline
	We know $B<W$, then we have $B'\ge 2W>W+B$, and that's impossible because $B'=W+B$. \newline
	This counterexample proves that we can only have one vehicle traveling all the vertices.
	\newpar
	Moreover, we have to prove this is the same solution to minimize weight in both problems.\newline
	As we know that each origin is exactly at the distance $W$ of destinations, no matter the place of origin chosen to go to destination, we will add $W$ to it.\newline
	So minimizing $B'$ is equivalent to minimize the distance between the origins $B$.\newline
	We proved \textbf{I} is a yes-instance for the HPP if \textbf{I'} is a yes-instance for the CPP.
	
	\subsection{Proof in the other way}
	
	Now that we have proved a way, let's prove that \textbf{I'} is a yes-instance for the CPP if and only if \textbf{I} is a yes-instance for the HPP.\newline
	Let's take a solution of the HPP. If we add an edge from one of the extremities of the path to the destination, then we have a solution for the CPP. \newline
	The choice of the added edge does not change anything to the solution since each origin is at equal distance $W$ from the destinations. It must be at one extremity to comply with the CPP. \newline
	As far as the number of vehicles is concerned, there can only be one since $B'=W+B$, as showed in section \ref{subsec:Proof of one way}.
	\newpar
	Now let's see if other constraints added to the problem influence the complexity.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OTHER CARACTERISTICS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Other caracteristics}
	
	\subsubsection{Time windows}
	
	The time windows associated with each vertex is not a problem because we can recreate any HPP instances where these constraints do not change the complexity of the problem.

	By leaving the free schedules as in this instance \ref{fig:CPP with time windows}, we prove that an instance of the problem is NP-hard.
	
	\subsubsection{Return management}
	
	Take the instance of the Figure \ref{fig:CPP with time windows}, we can imagine that the solution of return can be the same solution as to the opposite way, which proves that the complexity remains unchanged.
	
	\subsubsection{Different return locations}
	
	Let's take an example where the return is totally different.

	\chapter{Problem solving model}
	
	In this chapter we will see our choices of resolution, and how we have implemented these choices. 
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%% Resolution %%%%%%%%%%%% 
	\section{Resolution specificities}
	
	Here is a description and a comparison of how to solve the problem with different models. 
	
	\subsection{Different models}
	
	We have two types of models to implement in order to compare them: \newline
	Management of the return trip \textbf{associated} with the management of the home-to-work trip. \newline
	Management of the return trip \textbf{dissociated} with the management of the home-to-work trip.
	\newpar
	In other words, \textbf{dissociate} means that we have a model that manages the home-to-work trip, and another that manages the return, based on the outcome of the go, ie the results of the program for the go are part of the program data for the return. \textbf{Associate} means that our program manages all the trips directly with the starting dataset.
	\newpar
	For each of these two models, we have the case where the carpoolers are in the \textbf{same pool} for the home-to-work trip and the return trip, and the case where they can be in \textbf{different pools}
	\newpar
	Let's see some examples in the following content:

		\label{fig:dissociated programs}
	\end{figure}
	
	Figure \ref{fig:dissociated programs} represents two implemented dissociated model, where one is executed for the home-to-work trip, and the other one for the corresponding return trip. \newline
	We introduce the notion of people who are \textbf{left behind}. We can observe it in $(b)$, only taking into account the schedules of work's begining, this is obvious that we take only one car to save some fuel. However at the return trip, there are five hours of difference in schedules when they end the work. The person who took his car can go back home whereas the person who has not taken his car is stuck at work. \newline
	Of course, someone else would be able to pick up this person on the return run if there were more requests, but if this is not the case, this person is in the \textbf{left behind group}.\newline
	During the execution of these two dissociated models, there will be the number of people \textbf{left behind} in the solution.

	Figure \ref{fig:associated programs} shows that with the same initial data as in the figure \ref{fig:dissociated programs}, we have a different solution. Indeed, this time the management of the work and return to work are done at the same time, in the same system of decision support. So the solution for this one, knowing that on the return they will need theirs cars, is to take each their car at the start.
	\newpar
	The usefulness of having both types of models makes it possible to compare the execution times on the same number of users, as well as the value of solutions.

	\subsection{Heuristics used}
	
	\subsubsection{Finding satellites}
	During the study, we want to see the impact of the use of gathering places. Indeed, the places that we will call Satellites, can represent exits of motorway where to deposit people, to facilitate the movement of the users drivers. \newline
	The use of these satellites is done in data pre-management, where for example, people can be dropped on a motorway exit within 1 km of their work.\newline
	This use of satellite points makes it possible to have fewer destinations, since they will be, for some, gathered in these satellites.
	
	\subsubsection{Chose the data}
	
	Grenoble is surrounded by mountain ranges, a heuristic to gather the following data from where people come from works perfectly, and is an optimal solution since people would not have interest to go around the mountain ranges.
	
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{Mountains around Grenoble city}
		\label{fig:Mountains around Grenoble city}
	\end{figure}
	In Figure \ref{fig:Mountains around Grenoble city} the mountains are grayed and the blue arrows are rivers. This city configuration leaves only three major entrances, which are west, east and south. We can therefore create a group from each cardinality in order to increase the number of users taken into account by the decision system.
	\newpar
	We will now see which data are used by our models. 

	%%%%%%%%%%%%% DATA MODEL %%%%%%%%%%%% 
	\section{The data model}
	In this section, we will see the data are used by our models.
	
	\subsection{A representation in graph form}
	The requests and the travels can be represented by a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ where $V=\{1,...,4n\}$ is the set of Vertices and $A=\{arc(i,j) \forall i,j \in V\}$ is the set of Arcs. \newline
	All destinations of a person are shifted by $n$ from their first place. \newline
	For example the first user has the vertex pair $(1,1+n)$ corresponding to his home-work trip vertices, and the vertex pair $(1+2n,1+3n)$ corresponding to his return trip.

	\subsection{Sets's range} 
	
	We have $n$ users, each one having four summits, two for the home-work trip and two for the return trip respectively. 
	
	\begin{tabbing}
		$O=\{1,...,n\}$ \tab \tab \= Set of every possible driver/passenger. \\
		$D=\{n+1,...,2n\}$ \> Set of the workplaces. \\
		$U=O\cup D$ \> Set of home-to-work places. \\
	
		$K=\{2n+1,...,3n\}$ \> Set of the origins to return (may be the workplace). \\
		$L=\{3n+1,...,4n\}$ \> Set of the destinations to return (may be home). \\
		$W=K\cup L$ \> Set of return places. \\
	\end{tabbing}
	
	\subsection{Data used}
	In the dataset we have $C$ the cost matrix for moving from point i to point j represents either a distance, or a cost of gas, or a duration. $B$ and $E$ corresponds to the start and end time of the work, and $Q$ the capacity of the cars.
	
	\begin{tabbing}
		$C_{ij}$ \tab \= $\forall i,j\in V$ \tab \= Cost matrices for commuting $arc(i,j)$. \\
		
		$Q_{n}$ \> $\forall n\in O$ \> Car's capacity of the user $n$. \\
		
		$B_{v}$ \> $\forall v\in D$ \> Hour: Begining of work for the user $n$. \\
		$E_{v}$ \> $\forall v\in K$ \> Hour: End of work for the user $n$. \\
		
		$\gamma$ \> \> Percentage of the initial travel time added to the max travel time. \\
		$\delta$ \> \> Constant value added to the max travel time. \\
		$\alpha$ \> \> Allowed waiting time to get to work early. \\
		$\beta$ \> \> Allowed waiting time to leave work. \\
		
		$M$ \> \> A large enough constant. \\
	\end{tabbing}
	
	\subsection{Diagram representation of data}
	
	In the following, the UML representation allows to visualize the data in another way.
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{flushleft}
			\floatplacement{figure}{t}
			\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{img/i_umlproblemdata.png}
		\end{flushleft}
		\caption{UML problem diagram}
		\label{fig:UML Diagram}
	\end{figure}
	
	\noindent Figure \ref{fig:UML Diagram} represents the data model. \newline
	The abstract class \textbf{Place} corresponds to the location of a place. Four classes inherit it, namely the place \textbf{MorningHome} that contains the capacity of the user's car, the place \textbf{MorningWorkplace} containing the time at which he starts work, the place \textbf{EveningWorkplace} containing the time at which his work ends, and the place \textbf{EveningHome} where he returns after work. Of course the workplaces can be the same, as well as the residential places. The \textbf{Travel(Arc)} class represents the arcs of the graph. This class takes two places to determine the time/distance between them. The \textbf{Request(Vertex)} class represents the vertices of the graph. This class takes the four places of the user's day in order to form a request composed of four vertices. The \textbf{SystemManager} class corresponds to what the person using the system must set for the mathematical model to work properly.
	
	\subsection{The dissociated models}
	
	The dissociated models have a first model taking the morning places, and a second model taking the evening places plus the result of those who take their cars in the first model.
	\newpar
	The next section discusses the mathematical model of the Mixed Integer linear Programs we have implemented to solve the problem.
	
	%%%%%%% MATHEMATICAL MODEL %%%%%%%
	\section{Mathematical modeling}
	
	We have binary variables representing the choices that must be made by the program, and variables representing sequencing, ie the time at which a driver would take a passenger, or the number of passengers inside. of this car after picking up or dropping people.
	
	\subsection{Decision variables}
	\begin{tabbing}
		$x^{k}_{ij}$ \tab \= $\forall k\in O,\forall i,j\in V$\tab \= $=1$ if the travel of the $arc(i,j)$ is deserved by the driver $k$. \\
		$y^{k}$ \> $\forall k\in O$ \> $=1$ if the user $k$ is a driver. \\
		$z^{k}_{v}$ \> $\forall k\in O,\forall v\in V$ \> $=1$ if the user $k$ is picking or delivering the vertex $v$. \\
		$b^{k}_{v}$ \> $\forall k\in O,\forall v\in V$ \> Estimated passage time of the driver $k$ to the vertex $v$. \\
		$q^{k}_{v}$ \> $\forall k\in O,\forall v\in V$ \> Number of persons in the car $k$ at the vertex $v$. \\
	\end{tabbing}
	
	We will now see what objectives our decision support system has. 
	
	\section{Objective functions}
	\[ Minimize \] 
	\begin{tabbing}
		$ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}\sum_{\substack{i,j \in V}} C_{ij} \times x^{k}_{ij}$ \tab \tab \= The cost of all travels done \\
	\end{tabbing}
	
	Finally we will see the general and specific constraints of our models. For the sequencing constraints used in our models, we were inspired by Mr. Karimi \cite{karaoglanmemetic2015}, then we discovered a version of the more recent formula written by Mr. Karoaglan \cite{karimicapacitated2018}.
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
	\subsubsection{Path constraints}
	
	Each vertex haven't more than one outgoing arc.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}\sum_{\substack{j \in V,j\ne o}} x^{k}_{oj}\leq1 \tab \tab \forall o\in V \]
	
	Each vertex haven't more than one ingoing arc.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}\sum_{\substack{i \in V,i\ne d}} x^{k}_{id}\leq1 \tab \tab \forall d\in V \]
	
	A driver picks-up himself before picking up someone else, so he has two ingoing arc.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{j\in V}}x^{k}_{ij}\leq2\tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall i\in V \]
	
	A passenger has only one destination after being picked-up.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{j\in V,j\ne k,j\ne k+2n}}x^{k}_{ij}\leq1\tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall i\in V \]
	
	A driver is picking himself.
	\[ y^{k}=z^{k}_{k}\tab \tab \forall k\in O \]
	\[ y^{k}=x^{k}_{kk}\tab \tab \forall k\in O \]
	\[ x^{k}_{kk}=z^{k}_{k}\tab \tab \forall k\in O \]
	
	A non-driver can't pick himself.
	\[ x^{k}_{vv}=0 \tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall v\in V,v\ne k,v\ne(k+2n)\]
	
	A vertex $v$ is taken at most by one and only one driver.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}} z^{k}_{v}\leq1 \tab \tab \forall v\in V\]
	
	Prohibited cycles.
	\[ x^{k}_{ij}+x^{k}_{ji}\leq1\tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall i\in V,\forall j\in U,i\ne j \]
	
	Each driver must reach their destination.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}\sum_{\substack{i \in V}} x^{k}_{id}=1 \tab \tab \forall d\in D\cup L \]
	
	Each driver must leave their home and their worplace. 
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}\sum_{\substack{j \in V,j\ne o}} x^{k}_{oj}=1\tab \tab \forall o\in O \]

	If k is picking someone he delivers him at destination.
	\[ z^{k}_{o}==z^{k}_{o+n}\tab \tab \forall k\in O, o\in O\cup K \] 
	
	A driver never goes away from his destination.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{v\in D\cup v\in L}} x^{k}_{d,v}=0\tab \tab \forall k\in O \forall d=k+n\cup k+3n\]
	
	If $v$ is picked by $k$ then $k$ goes exactly one time to $v$.
	\[ z^{k}_{v}=\sum_{\substack{j\in U\cup W}} x^{k}_{vj} \tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall v\in U\cup W \]
	
	\subsubsection{Time constraints}
	
	The sum of the travels of a driver $\leq$ maximal time allowed on the road for this user.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{i,j\in U\cup W}}x^{k}_{ij}\times C_{ij}\leq (1+\gamma \% )\times C_{k,k+n}+\delta \tab \tab \forall k\in O \]
	
	Sequencing the hours of passages.
	\[ b^{k}_{j}\geq b^{k}_{i}-B_{k+n}+(C_{ij}+B_{k+n})\times x^{k}_{ij}+(B_{k+n}-C_{ij})\times x^{k}_{ji}\tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall i,j\in U,i\neq j \]
	\[ b^{k}_{j}\geq b^{k}_{i}-M+(C_{i-2n,j-2n}+M)\times x^{k}_{ij}+(M-C_{i-2n,j-2n})\times x^{k}_{ji}\tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall i,j\in W,i\neq j \]
	
	Everyone arrives between $[B-\alpha ,B]$.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}b^{k}_{v+n}\leq B_{v+n} \tab \tab \forall v\in O \]
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}b^{k}_{v+n}\geq B_{v+n} - \alpha \tab \tab \forall v\in O \]
	
	Everyone leaves between $[arrival Time-MaximalTravelTime ,arrival Time - C_{ij}]$.
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}b^{k}_{v}\leq (\sum_{\substack{k\in O}} b^{k}_{v+n})- C_{v,v+n} \tab \tab \forall v\in O \]
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}b^{k}_{v}\geq (\sum_{\substack{k\in O}} b^{k}_{v+n})- ((1+\gamma \% )\times C_{k,k+n}+\delta ) \tab \tab \forall v\in O \]
	
	Passage time is zero if vertex is not chosen.
	\[ b^{k}_{s}\leq z^{k}_{v}\times M \tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall v\in V \] 
	
	\subsubsection{Capacity constraints}
	
	Each passenger can be in a car. 
	\[ \sum_{\substack{k\in O}}y^{k}\times Q_{k}\geq n \] 
	
	A driver k is his first passenger.
	\[ q_{k}^{k}=y^{k}\tab \tab \forall k\in O \] 
	
	Sequencing the number of passengers after visiting a vertex.
	\[ q_{k}^{j}\ge q_{k}^{i}-Q^{k}+(nPassengers_{j}+Q^{k})\times x^{k}_{ij}+(Q^{k}-nPassengers_{i})\times x^{k}_{ji} \]
	\[ \forall k\in O,\forall i\in U\cup W,\forall j\in U\cup W\]
	
	If a driver k visits the vertex i then his capacity after visiting it can't exceed the capacity of his car.
	\[ q_{k}^{v}\le Q^{k}\times z^{k}_{v}\tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall v\in U\cup W \] 
	
	Return to home additional path constraints.\newline
	Each driver takes himself at the return.
	\[ x^{k-2n}_{kk}=y^{k-2n} \tab \tab \forall k\in K \] 
	
	\subsubsection{Same pool management}
	
	In order to have the same pool on the way back, we can force users picked-up from home-to-work trip to be picked-up by the same driver to the return trip.
	\[ z^{k}_{i}={k}_{i+2n} \tab \tab \forall k\in O,\forall i\in U \] 

	% USE
	\subsection{The use of the model}
	
	This mathematical model responds well to all the objectives that we set ourselves.

	Indeed, the places of the return trip may be different than home-to-work trip ones, and the hours of work are respected.
	
	We have access to the time values and capacity values at each vertex.
	
	\subsubsection{Limitations of the model}
	
	The number of users can not exceed thirty users because of the execution time which exponentially increases. The main cause is the management of sequencing, but it is necessary to not split it.
	\newpar
	We will now see how the experiments occurred.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%% PROCESS %%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section{Resolution process}
	
	We have two execution processes for experiments. We define for each one a maximum execution time $x$ of the linear program, as well as a number of run to make $y$.

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REAL DATA %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section{Name of the experiment}
	\subsection{Benchmarks}
	In the context of this type of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) problem, we retrieved data that M. GUO used during his tests, and that M. HSU Tienté was kind enough to send us.
	It is transformed real data, random data following a specific scheme 
	The data used by Mr GUO are modified data originally used by Li and Lim.
	REF PDPTW LI LIM
	Both of the two sets are composed of 9 instances with users from 100 to 400. The users in the first set are clustered distributed, so the set is named with C. The second set has the users allocated randomly, therefore is named with R.
	REF GUO
	For all the instances in these two sets, the depot in the original PDPTW of 100 clients is considered as the destination, while the coordinates the users are kept from the original benchmark. The values of maximum travel time Tk, the penalty pi, the earliest departure and latest arrival time ei and li of each user, were generated according to the research on the real world applications. The cost dij was computed as an integer value equal to edij, where edij is the Euclidean distance between user i and j. Travel times tij were assumed to be equal to the distances divided by 50 km/h (average travel speed). For each user, the car capacity Qk was set to 4, and the maximum ride time Tk was defined to be 1.5 times of the direct travel time from the user’s home to the destination. The penalty pi of each user was computed as two times of travel cost from user’s home directly to the destination. The latest arrival times li were uniform randomly selected in the interval from 8:30 am to 9:00 am, and earliest departure time of user i was computed as ei = li – max (ti0 + 0:30, 2ti0), where ti0 is the direct travel time from the user i’s home to the destination
